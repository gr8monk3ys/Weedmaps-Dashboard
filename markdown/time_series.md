1. **BERT Sentiment over Time**:
   - This plot tracks the sentiment of tweets over time as analyzed by the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.
   - It likely displays changes in sentiment scores across different months and years, allowing viewers to observe trends or shifts in public opinion.
   - The use of a time series plot makes it possible to correlate changes in sentiment with specific events or periods, such as legislative changes or public health developments.

2. **VADER Sentiment over Time**:
   - Similar to the BERT analysis, this plot uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to track public sentiment in tweets over time.
   - The plot would show how sentiments, as interpreted by VADER, have fluctuated, providing a comparative perspective to the BERT analysis.
   - VADER is particularly tuned to analyze sentiments in social media text, making this plot relevant for understanding real-time shifts in public opinion.

3. **GPT Sentiment over Time**:
   - This plot likely utilizes sentiment analysis based on a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model.
   - The time series visualization would present the sentiment scores or classifications across different time frames, offering another layer of sentiment analysis.
   - This approach might offer a more nuanced or different interpretation of sentiments compared to BERT and VADER, adding depth to the overall sentiment analysis.
