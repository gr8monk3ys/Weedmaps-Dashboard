The scatter plot provides a visual correlation between the presence of dispensaries and public sentiment. For instance, a clustering of points in the upper right corner would suggest that counties with more dispensaries tend to have more positive sentiment.
By using color and symbols for different years, the plot can also indicate temporal changes, such as whether increasing numbers of dispensaries correlate with increasingly positive or negative sentiment over time.
This visualization is valuable for stakeholders in the cannabis industry, policymakers, and social researchers, offering insights into how the accessibility of cannabis impacts community attitudes and how these attitudes evolve.
