1. **Dispensary Distribution by County**:
   - This chart visualizes the distribution of dispensaries across different counties in California. 
   - Data is grouped by 'County' from the `density` DataFrame, and the sum of 'Dispensary_Count' for each county is calculated.
   - The chart is a pie plot with a hole in the middle (donut shape), where each slice represents a county. The size of each slice is proportional to the number of dispensaries in that county.
   - This visualization offers an immediate understanding of which counties have higher or lower numbers of dispensaries. It's an effective way to convey geographical disparities in dispensary distribution across the state.

2. **License Type Distribution in Dispensaries**:
   - The second chart focuses on the distribution of different types of licenses held by dispensaries.
   - Data is sourced from the `dispensaries` DataFrame, specifically analyzing the 'License Type' column.
   - Similar to the first chart, this is also a donut chart where each segment indicates a different type of license.
   - The use of distinct colors for each license type, chosen from a palette of green shades, enhances the chart's readability. This visualization is crucial for understanding the diversity of dispensary operations in terms of licensing, revealing the predominant types of services and products available in the cannabis market in California.

Both charts provide critical insights into the cannabis industry's landscape in California, highlighting regional variations in dispensary prevalence and the range of operations as indicated by license types. These visualizations are not only informative but also engaging, making complex data easily digestible for a wide range of audiences.
